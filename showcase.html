			<p>In this project we worked with a client from ShirleyRyan Ability Lab in Chicago. The user had bilaretal above knee apmutations and had spent most of her adult life in a wheelchair. At the time of the project she was looking forward to start using prosthesis and needed a supporting walking device. Walkers on the current market could not cater for all her needs and thus we designed a walker customized for her. key features include back support, forward motion (inspired by the forward walker), hand support, and pool balls which were tested to be more sturdier. The design process took place over eight weeks -comprising mainly of user interviews, mockups, user testing and the final product.</p>
