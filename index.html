			<p><strong>Lean-On-Me,</strong> is a project I did for my Design Thinking and Communication class. It is a reverse walker consisting of two custom-built armrests, an adjustable seat and walker frame, and buckle straps to stabilize the userâ€™s prosthesis. The overall walker is constructed out of a modified forward walker. The Lean-on-Me satisfies the requirements of safety, adjustability, ease of use, and maintenance/durability laid out by our user.

			<p> <strong>LingoMate</strong> is a web app that fosters language learning through user-user interaction. Language is not just memorized words, it's a culture and and an experience. Users can learn more from native speakers of that language. Users are matched based on the languages they are interested in trading. For example, one user who speaks Ndebele and is interested in learning Spanish can be matched with a user interested in Ndebele and proficient in Spanish. The goal is to provide a fun and holistic way of adopting new languages. </p>
